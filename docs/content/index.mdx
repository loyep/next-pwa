# Welcome to DuCanh's PWA suite for Next.js!

## Variants

- There are two different variants of this plugin:

  - [`next-pwa`](/next-pwa/getting-started)
  - [`next-sw` (not stable)](/next-sw)

## What's the difference between these two?

- `next-pwa` is a stable package, which makes use of Workbox to generate the service worker for you. Many available
  configurations are inherited from it. This is the recommended option if you are not sure.
- `next-sw` is NOT stable, and is built from ground up. This one is more limited and lightweight.

## What's the plan for the future?

- In the future, I plan on supporting [`Turbopack`](https://turbo.build/pack) as soon as we get our hands on them.
